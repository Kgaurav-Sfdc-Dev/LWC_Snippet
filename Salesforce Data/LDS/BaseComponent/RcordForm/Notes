it has both the power means it can switch between the edit form and view form 

if recordid is passed as an attributes then it will be loaded as an edit and view mode 
if recordID is passed blank then it will be loaded as an create mode 

common attributes :

recordID

               full -> it will load all fields which are present in default layoyt 
               compact -> it will pick fields from the compavt layoyt

onsucess -call some fn 

mode : ->read only (for only viewing the record  ,can't be editable)
         view (allow only to view the rcored ,but can be make editable )
         edit (for editing the record ,then on click of save it will swich the form to view mode )


//code :-->
as soon as our component Load it will open as an create mode because recordID is empty 
then as user clicked On Submit ,record will be available 
so component will automatically switch to edit code / view mode.
