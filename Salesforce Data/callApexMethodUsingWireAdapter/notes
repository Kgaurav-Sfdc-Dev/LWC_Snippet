# Apex controller 
1. Class must be Public 
2. mehtod must have @auraEnabled Annotation 
3. mehtod must be public and static

Note :--
mehtod is called by wire service then make the mehtod (cacheable = True).



deepUnderstanding of wire service and adapter 
steps 1. import MehtodAliasName from '@salesforce/apex/CLASS_NAME/MEHTOD_NAME'
          meaning -> what ever the mehtod will retunr that will be store in 
                     wire adapter " MehtodAliasName "
                     
steps 2 : wire service will be used to read the data from wire adapter 
        
          syntax :
          @wire(MehtodAliasName)property ;

Explanation :
The property is assigned a default value after component construction 
and before any other lifecycle event.
THat default value is nothing But a Object with the properties 
data and error ,and both have the value stored Undefined 

means : property {data : Undefined ,error : Undefined };

Once the Component loaded and lifecycle event Occured 
if adapter provide some value to wire service Property then that will be stored in data properties of the Object 
and error become Undefined 
if adapter will not Provide any value then error Property assigned by eerro Object and data remains Undefined

Note : 
When data becomes available from the wire adapter, itâ€™s set in the data property (error remains undefined). When newer versions of the data are available, 
data is updated.

If an error occurs in the adapter, for example when retrieving the data, error is populated with an error object (data is set to undefined).
