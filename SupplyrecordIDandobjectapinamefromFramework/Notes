# Automatic supply of recordId and objectapiname is done by framework 
    when the component is placed on Object record Page(app builder record Pagee)

steps :
just declare two Public property 
1. recordId
2. objectapiName 

these two automatically get val from FRamework 

Note : if component placed on the other page 
        like Home page ,app page then these two property  have 
        null value.
        
        
        
        
Note : 
if @api recordId is givne wrong then component loaded as create mode (whith  field related to object Name )
if @api objectApiName is givne wrong then component not get loaded Only
