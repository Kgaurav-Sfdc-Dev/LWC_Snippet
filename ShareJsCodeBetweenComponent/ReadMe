# share common js code to different Lwc Copmponent 
--> Advantage : Maintainance of code becomes easy 
                changes made in js file reflect in all the component 
                

# steps to be followed 
1. create Lwc component whose Js file will contains the shared javascript code in mehtod
  and use ecport statement to export your mehtod as ECMAScript module 
  
  Syntax:  
   Component name is : Sharedjs
   
   const methodName =function(a,b)
   {
       
   }
   export {mehtodName}; 
   
   -->export the function like this ,Now any lwc component can use this 
   
2. create one more component where we have to use above ECMAScript 
   Lets take name is : random
   so in-randomjs
   
   synatx:
   import {mehtodName} from 'c/Sharedjs'
   
   once imported used it any where in ur random js file
